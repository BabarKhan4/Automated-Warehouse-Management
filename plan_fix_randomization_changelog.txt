Plan Execution Error Fix + Reset Randomization Update

Overview
This PR introduces two targeted improvements:
1. Fix: KeyError during plan execution caused by mismatched object ID casing.
2. Feature: Automatic randomization on Reset after a successful plan execution.

Fix: Plan Execution KeyError (e.g. "Error executing action ...: 'r2'")

Root Cause
Fast Downward outputs object names in lowercase (e.g. r2, p2), while the simulator stored them using uppercase IDs (R2, P2).
Direct lookups failed due to case sensitivity, triggering KeyError exceptions during plan execution.

Implemented Changes (plan_executor.py)
- Normalized all plan parameters to lowercase

  params = [p.lower() for p in parts[1:]]


- Stored robots and packages using lowercase keys
  self.robots = {r.id.lower(): r for r in robots}
  self.packages = {p.id.lower(): p for p in packages}


- Added safe, case-insensitive lookups with debug info


  robot = self.robots.get(robot_id.lower())
  if robot is None:
      print(f"DEBUG: robot lookup failed for '{robot_id}'. Known keys: {list(self.robots.keys())}")
      raise KeyError(robot_id)


- Set GUI flag after successful plan execution
  try:
      self.gui.last_execution_success = True
  except Exception:
      pass

Outcome
Planner-produced lowercase IDs are now correctly matched, eliminating KeyError exceptions and improving debug traceability.

2️⃣ Feature: Randomized Reset After Successful Plan

Goal
Automatically randomize robot and package positions when pressing Reset after a successful plan.
This ensures each new run starts with a fresh, unique scenario.

Implemented Changes (main.py)
- Enhanced setup_scenario() to support randomization
  def setup_scenario(randomize: bool = False, seed: int | None = None):
      if randomize:
          free_locs = env.get_locations()
          robot_pos = random.choice(free_locs)
          pkg_start = random.choice([loc for loc in free_locs if loc != robot_pos])
          pkg_dest  = random.choice([loc for loc in free_locs if loc not in (robot_pos, pkg_start)])


- Updated Reset logic to enable automatic randomization
  should_randomize = gui.randomize_enabled or getattr(gui, 'last_execution_success', False)
  reset_seed = None if should_randomize else gui.seed
  new_env, new_robots, new_packages = setup_scenario(randomize=should_randomize, seed=reset_seed)
  gui.last_execution_success = False

Outcome
- After a plan runs successfully, pressing Reset automatically generates a new randomized scenario.
- Manual toggling or a “Randomize” button is no longer required.

3️⃣ Cleanup (interface.py)
- Removed on-screen “Randomize” button per UX request.
- Randomization is now handled entirely through internal logic or CLI flag.

Summary of Files Modified
plan_executor.py — Lowercase normalization, safe lookups, debug print, success flag
main.py — setup_scenario(randomize, seed) update, improved Reset logic
interface.py — Removed “Randomize” button from GUI

Results
- No more KeyErrors from case mismatches.
- Reset now reliably produces a new randomized environment after successful plan execution.
- Cleaner interface with less manual toggling.
